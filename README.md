# Redundancy
Everyone's favorite classic pen and graph paper game now without the pen and graph paper!

Obviously in development (for however long i care to procrastinate)

Game takes place on a grid.  Opposing player bases branch out across the gridlines taking turns attempting to capture control points to gain more lines to build with.  player lines that intersect must 'battle' for control of space and building new lines must always be linked back to the player's base.  The objective is to surround, ie capture, the opposing player(s) base.

Rules:
Gameboard is set by placing opposing player bases unto the game board. A home bas capture points 'cp's into the grids.
